    "Helicopter escape is a rare event, yet when it happens, it normally involves high-profile criminals who have the resources and network to organise the risky attempt. These criminals are very dangerous if they're at large, thus it's important to reduce or prevent any further helicopter escapes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first few steps in accomplishing that would be the identification of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which countries have the highest helicopter escape attempts?\n",
    "2. Which countries have the highest helicopter escape success chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we recently read the [story](https://apnews.com/article/d9df3592a19041822a3c4055f9536505) of Michel Vaujour's wife who took flying lessons for months and attempted to free her husband by piloting a helicopter on her own. Inspired by the story, we would like to additionally investigate if the power of love has an impact on success chance."

The pilot, Brian Jenner, feigned a panic attack, put the helicopter through some rough maneuvers and was then able to convince Paquet, in the back seat of the Jet Ranger, to turn over her shotgun and her knife. Jenner then gave her the choice of any landing spot, except the prison. She chose to go back to the airport.\\n<p>The pilot then explained, in great detail, exactly where they were and where they would be landing on arrival at the Quebec City airport. He added that the police would surely be aware by then, that she had hijacked the helicopter but would not yet be aware that she had given up her arms to the pilot. All the time Jenner was squeezing the transmit button on his cyclic stick and the tower was picking up all the details. The moment they touched down at the airport, the woman left the helicopter but the police, who had been advised of the situation by the control tower, were hiding nearby, and captured Paquet within seconds.\\n</p>\\n</td></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><span data-sort-value=\\\"1983-01-31&#160;!\\\">January, 1983</span>\\n</td>\\n<td><span data-sort-value=\\\"Pentridge&#160;!\\\"><a href=\\\"/wiki/HM_Prison_Pentridge\\\" title=\\\"HM Prison Pentridge\\\">Pentridge (HM Prison)</a></span>\\n</td>\\n<td><span class=\\\"flagicon\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg.png\\\" decoding=\\\"async\\\" width=\\\"23\\\" height=\\\"12\\\" class=\\\"thumbborder\\\" srcset=\\\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg/35px-Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg/46px-Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg.png 2x\\\" data-file-width=\\\"1280\\\" data-file-height=\\\"640\\\" />&#160;</span><a href=\\\"/wiki/Australia\\\" title=\\\"Australia\\\">Australia</a>\\n</td>\\n<td style=\\\"background-color: #F2CECE;\\\">No\\n</td>\\n<td><span data-sort-value=\\\"McMillan, David\\\"><span class=\\\"vcard\\\"><span class=\\\"fn\\\"><a href=\\\"/wiki/David_McMillan_(smuggler)\\\" title=\\\"David McMillan (smuggler)\\\">David McMillan</a></span></span></span>\\n</td>\\n<td>Arrests were made for the 1983 attempted helicopter escape from Melbourne’s Pentridge Prison in Australia.<sup id=\\\"cite_ref-melbournecrime_12-0\\\" class=\\\"reference\\\"><a href=\\\"#cite_note-melbournecrime-12\\\">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> The three, all held on drug-importation charges, had hired a former <a href=\\\"/wiki/Special_Air_Service\\\" title=\\\"Special Air Service\\\">SAS</a> soldier, then living in the <a href=\\\"/wiki/Philippines\\\" title=\\\"Philippines\\\">Philippines</a>, to lift the prisoners from the jail’s tennis court to a nearby van fitted with panels to hide them for the 600 kilometre road trip to Sydney, where a yacht was to take them to <a href=\\\"/wiki/Manila\\\" title=\\\"Manila\\\">Manila</a>.\\n<p>The plan was thwarted when <a href=\\\"/wiki/Antony_Moynihan,_3rd_Baron_Moynihan\\\" title=\\\"Antony Moynihan, 3rd Baron Moynihan\\\">Lord Tony Moynihan</a>, himself an exile in the Philippines, informed the <a href=\\\"/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police\\\" title=\\\"Australian Federal Police\\\">Australian Federal Police</a>, who then ran it as a sting operation.

    "It turns out that the United States and Canada are tie for the highest helicopter escape success chance at 75%. France is a close second at approximately 73%. This is an important finding especially when we look at the results for France and the United States. Not only do they have high number of attempts, most of those attempts are more likely to succeed than fail. Our priority should be to investigate those two countries further in a different project. We should also consider looking into the other 3 countries especially Canada once we've investigated France and the United States.\n"
